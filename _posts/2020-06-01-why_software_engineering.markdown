Why? and Why Software Engineering?


Simplest answer is "Why Not?!".  Hey look at that "string" ! Lol.  

To answer the question honestly, I have dabbled with the thought about getting into tech for quite some time now.  A few years back I had the opportunity to learn Ruby.  I didn't realize at the time how much that would have changed my career options.  Well, I guess I had an idea!  I would assume most people are like me, we've worked jobs here and there. Tried our best to do our job finding it quite boring.  Long story short, financially I was not able to afford the program.  

Going back to myspace, changing the layout of the page color, etc.  that was the only experience I had with code.  Fast forward now, I see my children learning to code.  I see in a certain situation like what we are experiencing right now with the Pandemic, how much easier it would have been for me to provide for my family IF I had taken that Ruby program when I had the chance.  


1.)  Surround yourself with postive people who Inspire, Motivate, Teach & Challenge you to do better.

2.)  If you want to learn to do something then what better way to do it then to do it.  You want to be like someone whom          you look up to, then hang out with those type of people and network with them.

3.)  "When in doubt, Know your way out!" haha JK! You do have to have a plan.  That at least I can say I had help from the        CK community in this case.  I liked their "building good habits".  It was easy and comfortable to do.

4.)  Life's too short to not try!

I have a lot of odds against me like a being a mom of 3 (1 in elementary, 1 in middle and 1 in high!),  a wife, an Owner/Esthetician with a new business that opened September 2019 (Yes, right before the Pandemic really hit).  2020 is the year to invest in myself.  Pandemic or not at least I can say I did something.  

What about you?
